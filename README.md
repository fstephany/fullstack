# Full stack Rust Demo

This project demonstrates how to glue a rocket app and a WASM frontend using
wasm-run.

Goals:

- Rocket backend + WASM frontend + SCSS styling
- One command to start the whole shebang in development + display logs in console
- No Javascript/NodeJS needed to build
- Hot-compile for SCSS and WASM (but not hot reload in the browser yet)
